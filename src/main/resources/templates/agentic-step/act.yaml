  ## ACT PHASE: Transform Final Decisions into Actionable Goals
  
  **CRITICISM AND REFINEMENTS:**
  {criticizeResult}
  
  ## Instructions:
  Transform the refined decisions into specific, actionable goals.
  Provide clear commands or actions that should be taken.
  Ensure the actions are concrete, measurable, and implementable.
  
  Your actionable output should include:
  1. **Immediate Actions**: What needs to be done right now?
  2. **Specific Commands**: Clear, executable instructions
  3. **Resource Assignments**: Who or what will execute each action?
  4. **Success Criteria**: How will we know when each action is complete?
  5. **Priority Ordering**: What sequence should actions be performed in?
  6. **Quality Gates**: What checkpoints ensure quality execution?
  7. **Escalation Procedures**: What to do if actions fail or encounter issues?
  8. **Measurement Metrics**: How will progress and success be tracked?
  
  Format your output as concrete, implementable directives that can be executed immediately.
  Each action should be specific enough that there is no ambiguity about what needs to be done.
