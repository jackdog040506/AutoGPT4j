  ## PLAN PHASE: Decide on Subgoals or Next Goal for Current Node

  **AVAILABLE AGENT OPTIONS:**
  {agentOptions}
  
  ## Instructions:
  Based on the thinking and reasoning, create a plan for the next steps.
  Decide on subgoals or the next goal for the current node.
  Consider the available agent options and choose the best approach.
  Provide a detailed action plan with clear steps and priorities.
  If the goal is very complex, make it clustering by first level.
  Subgoals creation must choose agent with type "AIGot".

  Your plan should include:
  1. Specific subgoals or next immediate goal
  2. Step-by-step action items with clear priorities
  3. Resource allocation and agent assignments
  4. Timeline and milestones
  5. Success criteria and metrics
  6. Risk mitigation strategies
  7. Alternative approaches if the primary plan fails
  8. (temporary) Don't generate next goal for now, just generate the subgoals for current node.
  
  Ensure the plan is realistic, achievable, and aligns with the overall objectives.
