# Persistence Fixes Summary

## Issue
EngineExecution and EngineGoal status changes were not being persisted to the database, causing status updates to be lost when the application restarted or when entities were reloaded.

## Changes Made

### 1. ExecutorEngine.java
**File**: `src/main/java/com/james/autogpt/engine/ExecutorEngine.java`

**Changes**:
- Added `EngineExecutionRepository` dependency
- Added `engineExecutionRepository.save()` calls after each status update:
  - `ExecutionStatus.RUNNING` - when execution starts
  - `ExecutionStatus.COMPLETED` - when execution completes successfully
  - `ExecutionStatus.FAILED` - when execution fails
  - `ExecutionStatus.STALLED` - when execution requires requeue

**Code Changes**:
```java
// Update status to running and save
reloadedExecution.setStatus(ExecutionStatus.RUNNING);
engineExecutionRepository.save(reloadedExecution);

// In handleExecutionResult method:
execution.setStatus(ExecutionStatus.COMPLETED);
engineExecutionRepository.save(execution);
```

### 2. AIThinkingProcessor.java
**File**: `src/main/java/com/james/autogpt/engine/processors/AIThinkingProcessor.java`

**Changes**:
- Added `EngineGoalRepository` import and dependency
- Added `EngineExecutionRepository` import and dependency
- Added `engineGoalRepository.save()` calls after goal status updates:
  - `EngineGoalStatus.COMPLETED` - when AIThinking loop completes successfully
  - `EngineGoalStatus.FAILED` - when AIThinking loop fails
- Added `engineExecutionRepository.save()` call when creating new EngineExecution from PlanGoal

**Code Changes**:
```java
// Update goal status and save
execution.getGoal().setStatus(EngineGoalStatus.COMPLETED);
engineGoalRepository.save(execution.getGoal());

// In catch block:
execution.getGoal().setStatus(EngineGoalStatus.FAILED);
engineGoalRepository.save(execution.getGoal());

// When creating new EngineExecution from PlanGoal:
EngineExecution engineExecution = new EngineExecution();
// ... set properties ...
EngineExecution savedExecution = engineExecutionRepository.save(engineExecution);
```

### 3. AIGotProcessor.java
**File**: `src/main/java/com/james/autogpt/engine/processors/AIGotProcessor.java`

**Changes**:
- Added `EngineGoalRepository` import and dependency
- Added `engineGoalRepository.save()` calls after goal status updates in all handler methods:
  - `handleRefining()` - marks goal as COMPLETED
  - `handleBacktracking()` - marks goal as COMPLETED
  - `handleAggregating()` - marks goal as COMPLETED
  - `handleBranching()` - marks goal as COMPLETED
  - Main process method - marks goal as FAILED on exception

**Code Changes**:
```java
// In each handler method:
execution.getGoal().setStatus(EngineGoalStatus.COMPLETED);
engineGoalRepository.save(execution.getGoal());

// In main process method:
execution.getGoal().setStatus(EngineGoalStatus.FAILED);
engineGoalRepository.save(execution.getGoal());
```

## Benefits

1. **Data Persistence**: All status changes are now properly saved to the database
2. **State Recovery**: Application can recover execution state after restarts
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of execution status changes is maintained
4. **Consistency**: Database state always reflects the current execution status
5. **Monitoring**: External monitoring systems can track execution progress accurately

## Testing

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Create a test task**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/ai-planner \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Persistence Fix",
    "masterPrompt": "Test the persistence of status changes.",
    "rootPrompt": "Verify that status changes are saved.",
    "majorAgentId": "ai-thinking-001",
    "agentIds": ["ai-thinking-001", "task-executor-001"]
  }'
```

2. **Check database for status changes**:
```sql
-- Check EngineExecution status
SELECT id, status, date_created, date_updated 
FROM engine_execution 
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT id FROM engine_goal WHERE name LIKE '%Test Persistence Fix%'
);

-- Check EngineGoal status
SELECT id, name, status, date_created, date_updated 
FROM engine_goal 
WHERE name LIKE '%Test Persistence Fix%';
```

3. **Verify status progression**:
- EngineExecution should progress: `STALLED` → `RUNNING` → `COMPLETED`
- EngineGoal should progress: `PENDING` → `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`

## Notes

- All save operations are performed within `@Transactional` contexts
- The fixes maintain the existing lazy loading fixes from the previous update
- Status changes are saved immediately after being set, ensuring consistency
- Error handling ensures that failed executions are properly marked and saved
- **TaskServiceImpl** and **TaskCreationService** were already properly saving EngineExecution entities
- **AIThinkingProcessor** was the only place where EngineExecution creation was missing the save operation
