# Testing EngineExecution Persistence Fix

## Issue Fixed
The `AIThinkingProcessor.convertAndAddPlanGoalsToTaskNode()` method was creating new `EngineExecution` entities but not saving them to the database, causing them to be lost.

## Fix Applied
Added `EngineExecutionRepository` dependency and `engineExecutionRepository.save()` call in the `AIThinkingProcessor`.

## Test Steps

### 1. Create Test Agents
```bash
# Create AIThinking agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "ai-thinking-001",
    "roles": "thinking, planning, analysis",
    "focus": "Strategic thinking and task planning",
    "personality": "Analytical and strategic thinker",
    "agentType": "AIThinking"
  }'

# Create TaskExecutor agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentId": "task-executor-001",
    "roles": "task execution, implementation",
    "focus": "Executing assigned tasks",
    "personality": "Efficient and reliable executor",
    "agentType": "TaskExecutor"
  }'
```

### 2. Create AI-Planner Task
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/tasks/ai-planner \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test EngineExecution Persistence",
    "masterPrompt": "You are a development coordinator. Create a plan with multiple sub-goals.",
    "rootPrompt": "Analyze the requirements and create a detailed development plan with clear sub-tasks.",
    "majorAgentId": "ai-thinking-001",
    "agentIds": ["ai-thinking-001", "task-executor-001"]
  }'
```

### 3. Check Database for EngineExecution Creation

After the AIThinking processor runs and creates PlanGoals, check the database:

```sql
-- Check if EngineExecution entities were created from PlanGoals
SELECT 
    ee.id,
    ee.status,
    ee.date_created,
    eg.name as goal_name,
    eg.description as goal_description,
    a.agent_id,
    a.agent_type
FROM engine_execution ee
JOIN engine_goal eg ON ee.goal_id = eg.id
JOIN agent a ON ee.agent_id = a.id
WHERE eg.name LIKE '%Test EngineExecution Persistence%'
ORDER BY ee.date_created DESC;
```

### 4. Expected Results

**Before Fix**: 
- Only the initial EngineExecution would be saved
- PlanGoal-derived EngineExecution entities would be missing from the database

**After Fix**:
- Multiple EngineExecution entities should be present
- Each PlanGoal should have a corresponding EngineExecution
- All EngineExecution entities should have proper relationships with EngineGoal and Agent

### 5. Check Logs

Look for these log messages indicating successful EngineExecution creation:

```
INFO - Successfully added EngineGoal 'Sub-task 1' with EngineExecution 'execution-id-1' to TaskNode task-node-id
INFO - Successfully added EngineGoal 'Sub-task 2' with EngineExecution 'execution-id-2' to TaskNode task-node-id
```

### 6. Verify Relationships

Check that the relationships are properly established:

```sql
-- Check EngineGoal-EngineExecution relationships
SELECT 
    eg.id as goal_id,
    eg.name as goal_name,
    COUNT(ee.id) as execution_count
FROM engine_goal eg
LEFT JOIN engine_execution ee ON eg.id = ee.goal_id
WHERE eg.name LIKE '%Test EngineExecution Persistence%'
GROUP BY eg.id, eg.name;

-- Check TaskNode-EngineGoal relationships
SELECT 
    tn.id as task_node_id,
    tn.name as task_node_name,
    COUNT(eg.id) as goal_count
FROM task_node tn
LEFT JOIN engine_goal eg ON tn.id = eg.task_node_id
WHERE tn.name LIKE '%Test EngineExecution Persistence%'
GROUP BY tn.id, tn.name;
```

## Verification Points

1. **EngineExecution Count**: Should have multiple EngineExecution entities (initial + PlanGoal-derived)
2. **Status**: All EngineExecution entities should have `STALLED` status initially
3. **Relationships**: Each EngineExecution should be properly linked to EngineGoal and Agent
4. **Persistence**: EngineExecution entities should survive application restarts
5. **Logging**: Success messages should include both EngineGoal and EngineExecution IDs

## Troubleshooting

If EngineExecution entities are still missing:

1. **Check Transaction**: Ensure `@Transactional` is working properly
2. **Check Repository**: Verify `EngineExecutionRepository` is properly injected
3. **Check Logs**: Look for any exceptions during save operations
4. **Check PlanGoals**: Verify that PlanGoals are being generated by the AIThinking processor
